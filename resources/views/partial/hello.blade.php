                I'm Maruf hasan as  a  self-motivated  and  responsible  person,  I  believe  on  one  sentence,  "The  riskiest thing is to take no risks." Therefore, I love problem solving, taking risk, trying to be bold and explore myself at technological Ô¨Åeld. At the same time, I am looking forward to challenging and growth oriented tasks that help to prove the best of my ability in achieving the objective of the job.

                At this moment you already know my name, yes it's Md. Maruf Hasan. I'm a very ordinary man with some extraordinary dreams. I always like to do something new and solve the problems we are facing in our regular life in different ways and sometimes like to use shortcuts. Actually I'm a programmer and I love coding very much. Sometimes I also code on my dream! I know that's funny. I also make tools or snippets to make my regular work easier and faster such as code generator,array generator, file converter, data scapping tools etc. I like to face the challenges but don't like to do the same type of task repeatedly such as CRUD and other types of work that I have already solved, that makes me bored very much. My favourite areas are IOT, Machine Learning, System Programming, Image Processing, Advance Server Management etc. but my profession is little different. I'm a professional web developer but I also work on desktop and mobile app development and I like this job too.
